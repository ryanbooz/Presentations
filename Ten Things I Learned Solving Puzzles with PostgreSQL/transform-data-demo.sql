 * Recursive queries
 * 
 * These are two more straight forward examples of recursive queries.
 * 
 * In the Advent of Code solutions, using recursive queries was necessary
 * to handle many of the puzzles because they required referenceing previous
 * data transformations. In SQL, a recursive query is the only way to do
 * that unless you write a function or stored procedure. That would be a 
 * fine option, but my original goal was to just use SQL directly.
 * 
 * The first example uses a very simple set of data (above) to show
 * two iterations of a filesystem listing to fine parent/child relationships.

 * One last example that requires no table data is the Fibonacci sequence.

 * This also shows an example of needing to set an "end point" for the
 * recursion. Without the WHERE clause, this would run forever, or at least
 * until PostreSQL crashes. Always be aware of how your recursion is

 * FILTER Clause
 *

 * queries and for solving a problem like we had on day 1 of AoC.
